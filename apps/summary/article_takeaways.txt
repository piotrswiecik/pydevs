The article titled "Generatywne AI w praktyce" discusses the practical applications of generative AI in the field of graphic design and image manipulation. Here are the key points extracted from the content:

### Overview of Generative AI in Graphics
- Generative AI is capable of processing text, audio, and interpreting images, and it enables the manipulation and generation of new graphics and photos.
- Traditionally, graphic design was not directly associated with programming, but with the rise of generative AI, designers and illustrators are encouraged to explore tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.

### Examples of Tools
1. **Picthing**: 
   - Developed by Theo from `t3.gg`, this tool effectively removes backgrounds from images with improved quality.
   - Demonstrates how generative AI can be used to create useful products.

2. **Pieter Levels' Projects**:
   - **PhotoAI** and **InteriorAI** tackle specific problems and validate their usefulness with published statistics.

### Current Capabilities of Image Generation
- The progress in generative graphics over the last two years has been significant, although there are still limitations.
- Limitations include difficulties in generating specific image elements like text, hands, and reflections.
- Quality of generated images is high, but achieving desired outcomes often requires multiple attempts.

### Image Manipulation Techniques
- Generative models allow for:
  - Scaling images while maintaining detail.
  - Automatic background removal, even in complex cases.
  - Generating consistent images that meet branding requirements.
  - Creating various formats from existing graphics.
  - Approximate visualizations based on descriptions and reference images.

### Prompt Design Techniques
- Creating effective prompts for generative models requires a different approach than for language models (LLMs).
- Short prompts with keywords work better than lengthy descriptions, but experimentation is encouraged.
- Meta prompts can be used for generating multiple variations of graphics while maintaining a consistent style.

### Template-Based Graphics Generation
- Tools like **htmlcsstoimage** allow for the generation of images using HTML templates, enabling dynamic text and image replacement.
- Combining generative graphics with Vision Language Models enhances the creation of tailored templates.

### Conclusion
- Generative graphics tools enable automation and specialized tools for transforming images based on defined styles.
- Notable tools include ComfyUI and HTMLCSStoImage, which intersect with programming and can support marketing and product processes.
- Understanding how to utilize generative graphics in programming can lead to valuable applications in design, advertising, and photo editing.

### Important Note
- The article concludes with a note for readers without suitable computers to run ComfyUI, suggesting they skip the subsequent video content.

Overall, the article emphasizes the transformative potential of generative AI in graphic design and the importance of exploring these tools for both designers and developers.
