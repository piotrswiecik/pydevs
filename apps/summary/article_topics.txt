The article titled "Generatywne AI w praktyce" discusses the capabilities and applications of generative AI in image manipulation and creation. Here are the key points extracted from the content:

### Overview of Generative AI in Image Creation
1. **Generative AI Applications**:
   - Generative AI can process text, audio, and interpret images.
   - It holds potential for generating and manipulating graphics and photos.

2. **Tools and Examples**:
   - **Midjourney** and **Stable Diffusion** are highlighted as tools for designers and illustrators.
   - **Picthing**: A tool for background removal, showcasing improved quality through generative AI.
   - **PhotoAI** and **InteriorAI** by Pieter Levels address specific problems and demonstrate utility through published statistics.

3. **Current Image Generation Capabilities**:
   - Significant advancements in generative graphics over the last two years.
   - Challenges remain, particularly in generating specific elements (text, hands, reflections) and following complex prompts.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Generating individual elements (textures, backgrounds) and editing existing images.
   - The ability to create templates for marketing materials, allowing easy updates to images and text.

### Technical Aspects
1. **Model Availability**:
   - Interest in API access and self-hosting options for models.
   - Platforms like **Replicate** and **Leonardo.ai** for API access; **RunPod** for GPU hosting.

2. **Prompt Design Techniques**:
   - Effective prompts are crucial for generating desired images.
   - Short and keyword-focused prompts are generally recommended, but experimentation is encouraged.

3. **Generative Templates**:
   - Using tools like **htmlcsstoimage** to generate graphics from HTML templates.
   - The ability to dynamically replace text, images, and styles.

### Conclusion
- Generative graphics tools can automate and enhance image transformation processes.
- **ComfyUI** and **HTMLCSStoImage** are particularly noteworthy for their intersection with programming.
- Understanding how to leverage generative graphics models can significantly benefit marketing and product development processes.

### Important Note
- The article suggests that users without suitable hardware for working with **ComfyUI** may skip additional video content included in the article.

This summary captures the essence of the article, emphasizing the potential of generative AI in graphic design and its practical applications.
