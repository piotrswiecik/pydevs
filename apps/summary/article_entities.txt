The article titled 'Generatywne AI w praktyce' discusses the capabilities of generative AI in graphic design and image generation. Here are the key points extracted:

### Overview of Generative AI in Graphics
- Generative AI can process text, audio, and interpret images, with a focus on graphic design and photo manipulation.
- Tools like **Midjourney** and **Stable Diffusion** are primarily targeted at designers and illustrators.
- The article highlights tools such as **picthing**, which improves background removal quality, and projects by **Pieter Levels** like **PhotoAI** and **InteriorAI**, showcasing practical applications of generative AI.

### Current Capabilities of Image Generation
- The development of generative graphics has advanced significantly over the past two years.
- Limitations still exist, particularly in generating specific image elements (e.g., text, hands, reflections), although models like **Flux** are improving.
- Generative models can produce high-quality images, but achieving desired results often requires extensive experimentation.

### Technical Aspects
- Models can be accessed through APIs or self-hosting options, with services like **Replicate** and **Leonardo.ai** for API access, and **RunPod** for GPU hosting.
- Templates can be used for generating marketing materials, allowing for efficient creation of consistent designs across various formats.

### Techniques for Prompt Design
- Writing prompts for image generation differs from text-based models; they require keywords and control flags rather than detailed instructions.
- Experimentation with prompt length and content is encouraged, as seen in examples from **Midjourney**.
- The article discusses the use of **meta prompts**, which allow for consistent style while varying specific elements.

### Generating Graphics Based on Templates
- Tools like **htmlcsstoimage** enable dynamic graphic generation from HTML templates, integrating CSS for styling.
- A workflow can be created to automate graphics generation based on events, such as blog posts or newsletters.

### Conclusion
- Generative graphic tools can automate and enhance the image transformation process, making them valuable even for those not directly involved in graphics.
- **ComfyUI** and **HTMLCSStoImage** are highlighted as particularly useful for developers looking to integrate generative graphics into applications.
- The potential applications of generative AI in marketing, product development, and design are emphasized.

This summary encapsulates the main themes and insights from the article, focusing on the practical applications and technical aspects of generative AI in graphic design.
