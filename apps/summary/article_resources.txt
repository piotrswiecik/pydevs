The article titled "Generatywne AI w praktyce" discusses the practical applications of generative AI in image manipulation and creation. Here are the key points extracted from the content:

### Overview of Generative AI Capabilities
- **Text and Audio Processing**: Generative AI can effectively process text and audio, as well as interpret images.
- **Image Manipulation and Generation**: The focus is on how generative AI can be used for creating and manipulating graphics and photos.

### Tools and Examples
1. **Picthing**: A tool for effectively removing backgrounds from images, showcasing significant quality improvements.
2. **PhotoAI and InteriorAI by Pieter Levels**: Address specific problems in image processing and demonstrate their usefulness with published statistics.

### Current Image Generation Capabilities
- There has been substantial progress in generative graphics over the last two years, with improvements in quality, although some limitations remain, such as generating text, hands, and reflections accurately.
- Generative models like **Flux** are improving but still have inconsistent results with complex prompts.

### Techniques for Image Generation
- **Prompt Design**: Generating images requires careful crafting of prompts, which vary significantly from traditional LLM prompts. Keywords and controlling flags are essential.
- **ComfyUI**: A tool that allows for greater control over generated graphics, including the use of templates and reference images for maintaining style consistency.

### Applications of Generative Graphics
- **Template Generation**: Generative AI can create marketing materials in various formats based on templates, which is more efficient than manual design.
- **Dynamic Content Creation**: Tools like **htmlcsstoimage** can generate graphics from HTML templates, allowing for dynamic updates of text and images.

### Summary of Benefits
- Generative graphics tools enable automation and specialized solutions for transforming images according to defined styles.
- Tools like **ComfyUI** and **HTMLCSStoImage** intersect with programming, allowing for the development of advanced solutions that support marketing and product processes.

### Conclusion
The article emphasizes the importance of understanding generative graphics technologies, even for those not directly involved in graphic design, as they can significantly enhance marketing and product development processes.

### Important Note
The article concludes with a note for readers without access to suitable hardware for using ComfyUI, suggesting they may skip the accompanying video tutorial.
